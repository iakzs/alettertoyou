## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

I take security seriously in this project. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please let me know as soon as possible. I appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure.

To report a security vulnerability, please contact me directly via email at [koslz@duck.com](mailto:koslz@duck.com). I kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until I have had an opportunity to address it.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

I kindly request that you follow these guidelines when reporting security vulnerabilities:

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
- Avoid any destructive testing, such as attempting to access or modify data without permission.
- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until I have had an opportunity to address it.

## Response Timeline

Upon receiving a security vulnerability report, I will acknowledge the report and work to investigate and address the issue promptly. I aim to provide regular updates on my progress and resolve security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Security Updates

I am committed to providing timely security updates to users of this project. When security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed, I will release updates and patches as soon as possible. I encourage all users to keep their software up to date to benefit from the latest security enhancements.

Thank you for helping me keep this project safe and secure!
